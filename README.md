# FsWpfPlot
Basic 3d plot functionality for greater autonomy when using fsi to explore data series.

Originally meant to be used as a quick and repl-friendly tool for 3d visualization using WPF, but charting support for F# has since moved on with leaps and bounds, so I am no longer pursuing this end.

It's still a pretty ok example of WPF/XAML + F# integration, so I hope someone finds it a useful point of reference.
